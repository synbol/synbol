### About Me

👯 Hi, I am [ [辛毅](https://synbol.github.io/) | [Synbol](https://synbol.github.io/) ] from State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University (南京大学).

🔭  I’m currently working on machine learning topics including:

- Visual Generation
  - Diffusion Models: [ [Lumina-Image 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21758) ] [ [Lumina-Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06782) ] 
  - AutoRegressive Models: [ [Lumina-mGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02657) ] [ [Lumina-mGPT 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801) ]
  - Discrete Diffusion Models: [ [Lumina-DiMOO]() ] [ [MaskGIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13032) ]
   
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
  - Benchmark: [ [Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02242) ] [ [Benchmark](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/935de67d1a033fd517cb49d192b5c008-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track.html) ]
  - Algorithm: [ [VMT-Adpater](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29541) ] [ [MMAP](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29540) ] [ [TP-PTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22872) ]

🌱  I'm interested in various competitions such as kaggle:

- Digital China Innovation Contest, Champion（1 / 1538）, 100,000 RMB. [[Solution](https://github.com/synbol/Kaggle-Contests/tree/main/1.Digital%20China%20Innovation%20Contest)]
